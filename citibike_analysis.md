# NYC CituBike Analysis
- The goal of this project
- Used data, resources and technoligies
- Analysis Summary
- Conclusion

## The goal - trying to answer core questions about opening a bike-sharing business in Des Moines by visualizing and analyzing a data set of a bike-sharing program in New York City

## In this project the following technoligies, resources and data had been used
- Tableau - as an interactive data visualization software
- Data set of Citibike in NYC as CSV and Excel files
- Internet research on NYC and Des Moines information on multiple websites
- GitHub and VS Code for publishing

## Analysis Summary

1. Bike Sharing is a widely used public transportation in New York City. Cycling has been growing over the years and became very popular with commuters, tourists and many others. 
The city's large cycling population includes utility cyclists, such as delivery and messenger services; cycling clubs for recreational cyclists; and increasingly commuters. Cycling in New York City is associated with mixed cycling conditions that include urban density, relatively flat terrain, congested roadways with "stop-and-go" traffic, and many pedestrians. Cycling is increasingly popular in New York City; in 2017 there were approximately 450,000 daily bike trips, compared with 170,000 daily bike trips in 2005.

In August there were 2.3 million rides in NYC. The most congested area is Manhattan where are 1.77 rides out of 2.3
2. The second slide showcasts breakdown by age group, gender and reak hours. People of age between 19 and 60 are more likely to use CitiBikes and men are more tent to participate in the bike sharing program. Peak hours are falling in the range between 6 am and 11 pm.

3. As we know the age group of most active bike users and that men use it more tham women we would want to look at demographic data of NYC and Des Moines. The percentage of age category and gender is almost similar while the population of these cities is very different. It is refkected on the next slide.

4. Manhattan area has the highest density. It may explane such a big demand for bikes as it could be the only way to commute in some cases. Moreover, the difference in households of the two cities without a car is impressive.

The New York population is about 8.3 M people. It has been increasing over the years and according to "NYC Open Data" website it will continue to grow. 
The population of Des Moines is about 0.2 M people and remained at this level during past few years.
According to the Wikipedia articles 52% of NY households do not have a car compared to only abot 9% of Des Moines households that do not have a car.

Living and area conditions could be the cause of a very high demand of using bikes in NYC while in Des Moines it may not be a necessity.

5. Tourism impact.
New York is one of the most popular places in the world and millions of tourists visit it every year - annual record of approximately 63 million visitors in 2017. About 12 million out of them are from outside the US and most likely are using public transportation and bikes. Most of NY attractions are located in Mahattan so the traffic if very big.

On the other hand, the number of visitors in Des Moines is about 20% of New York visitors - 14 million visitors were recorded in 2016. Most likely all of them are local to the US and tent to traveling by car. Which means they may not need to use bikes. Also,  the number of attractions is tramendously smaller in Des Moines compared to NYC.

6. There is one more thing to consider - weather.
The number of rides falls signifficantly in winter. According to the data from in the internet usage of CitiBikes in New York City decreases by 5 times. Obviously it results in  revenue decrease which can be very crusial especialy for such a small town like Des Moines. If the demand in NYC may be caused by the necessity it may not be the case for Des Moines. So the usage of bikes in Des Moines in winter can be very close to zero.

## Conclusion (slide 7):
According to the B-Cycle of Des Moines web site the B-Cycle company introduces the bike sharing program to the city in 2010. It currently has about 20 stations and around 120 bikes since the bike sharing program statred in 2010.
Another article of https://www.desmoinesregister.com/   had said  in 2018 that some underused stations has been moved to suburban areas and the city advertised the program to attract customers. With that said the progress is going very slow in Des Moines.

There is a table on a Tableau slide to compare the two cities. The table contains all data that we collected. We can see the obvious picture.
Maybe it would be better to invest in the CitiBike program in bigger cities with high population and density where living conditions are very similar to NYC. Natural necessity  helps the demand plus of course visitors and recreational purposes.
